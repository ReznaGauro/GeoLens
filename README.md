# GeoLens

Welcome fellow coders to the GitHub repository for my M.Sc. EAGLE (Earth Observation And Geoanalysis of the Living Environment) course projects! :)
Get ready to embark on an epic quest through the realms of data and pixels, where each commit propels us closer to unraveling the mysteries of our planet. Here, amidst the lines of code and geospatial wizardry, lies a treasure trove of innovative projects that I've crafted during my master's studies. From cracking the code of groundbreaking research to wielding the power of practical applications, brace yourselves to witness the tangible outcomes of my academic journey. So, grab your keyboards and strap on your geospatial goggles as we journey together through the exciting terrain of spatial analysis and environmental insights! Let's embark on this knowledge-sharing adventure together!
